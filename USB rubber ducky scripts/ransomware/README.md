# Mini-Kenyatta Ransomware
    This script searches for startup folders and encrypts the files by appending ".kenyatta" to the encrypted files.
    It also deletes the unencrypted startup folder 🤣
    It uses GPG encryption (gpg is the OpenPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). 
    It is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP standard)
