REM This script scans a network for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices and attempts to identify them.

REM Change the value of the "network_range" variable to your desired network range
SET network_range "192.168.0.0/24"

REM Use Nmap to perform a TCP SYN scan on the specified network range, looking for open ports
nmap -sS -p1-65535 %network_range% -oG - | grep open > open_ports.txt

REM Use Nmap to perform a service version detection on the specified network range
nmap -sV -p1-65535 %network_range% -oG - | grep open > version_info.txt

REM Use Nmap's NSE scripts to identify the operating system of the devices
nmap -O -p1-65535 %network_range% -oG - | grep open > os_info.txt

REM Use Nmap to scan for common ICS and IoT devices
nmap --script=ics-enum,iot-enum -p1-65535 %network_range% -oG - | grep open > ics_iot_info.txt

REM Display the results of the scans
type open_ports.txt
type version_info.txt
type os_info.txt
type ics_iot_info.txt
